Travelling Salesman Problem is an NP hard prob-
lem in combinatorial optimization. It has many related appli-
cations like Routing problem or DNA sequencing. This work
evaluates performance improvement from multiple optimizations
on the Travelling Salesman Problem and Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm.
The paper also consists of the optimization techniques provided
by the Charm++ framework. The optimizations used are adaptive
grain 1 size control, speculation and prioritized execution, dis-
tributed task scheduling, support for branch and bound search
